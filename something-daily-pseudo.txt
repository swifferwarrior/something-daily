Something Daily (SD) is a GTD inspired app.

SD will integrate with a calendar app (Plans for GMail then Outlook). You choose from a list or create a category of tasks you would like to accomplish (i.e.
Something Cleaned, Something Fixed, Something Made, etc.) Each category stores a list of tasks to accomplish. By default, it will choose one task at random from a category
and set a reminder or task for it to be completed within the chosen calendar app. You can specify what task you would like to prioritize in each category. By default it will
choose three Something categories and send daily reminders.
